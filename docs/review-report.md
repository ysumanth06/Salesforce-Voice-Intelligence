## Step 1: Story Inventory

| Story File | Title | Type | Priority | Status |
|-----------|-------|------|---------|--------|
| `task_story_00.md` | Foundation: Fields, Named Cred, PS, TestDataFactory | FULL | P1 | DRAFT |
| `task_story_01.md` | Audio Recording & File Save | FULL | P1 | DRAFT |
| `task_story_02.md` | Streaming Transcription Controller | FULL | P1 | DRAFT |
| `task_story_03.md` | VoiceTranscriptionService & Task Extraction | FULL | P1 | DRAFT |
| `task_story_04.md` | Voice Intelligence Panel Dashboard | FULL | P2 | DRAFT |
| `task_story_05.md` | Cross-Object Compatibility & Mobile | DECLARATIVE | P3 | DRAFT |
| `task_story_06.md` | Integration Validation & DocGen Check | DECLARATIVE | P1 | DRAFT |

## Step 2: Dependency Graph Validation

### Parsed Graph

```
task_story_00 (Foundation) ⛔ BLOCKS ALL
│
├── [P] task_story_01 (Audio Recording)
│       └── task_story_03 (TranscriptionService) — REQUIRES 01
│               └── task_story_04 (Intelligence Panel) — REQUIRES 01, 03
│                       └── task_story_05 (Cross-Object/Mobile) — REQUIRES 01, 04
│
├── [P] task_story_02 (StreamingTranscriptionController) — parallel with 01
│
└── task_story_06 (Integration Validation) ⛔ REQUIRES ALL — BLOCKS /sfspeckit-deploy

[P] = Can begin in parallel immediately after Story-000 completes
```

### Validation Results

| Check | Result | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| ✅ Circular dependencies | NONE | Graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) |
| ✅ Foundation story present | PASS | `task_story_00.md` exists and blocks all |
| ✅ No orphan stories | PASS | All stories connect to the dependency chain |
| ✅ Story-06 gates all | PASS | Integration story requires all previous stories |
| ⚠️ Story-01 / Story-02 coupling | FLAGGED | See Risk-001 below |

## Step 3: Deployment Order Validation (Within Stories)

| Story | Layer Order | Valid? | Notes |
|-------|-------------|--------|-------|
| 003-00 | Metadata → Apex (TestDataFactory) | ✅ | Correct — fields before factory |
| 003-01 | Apex → LWC → Tests | ✅ | Controller before component |
| 003-02 | Apex → Tests | ✅ | Apex-only story |
| 003-03 | Apex → Tests | ✅ | Queueable + tests |
| 003-04 | Apex additions → LWC → Tests | ✅ | Apex methods before LWC that calls them |
| 003-05 | LWC config only | ✅ | No ordering risk |
| 003-06 | Validation only | ✅ | No deployment artifacts |

**Deployment Order: ✅ ALL CLEAN**

---

## Step 4: Merge Conflict Risk Analysis

### 🔴 RISK-001: `AudioRecorderController.cls` Modified by Two Stories

**Files at risk**:
- `force-app/main/default/classes/AudioRecorderController.cls`
- `force-app/main/default/classes/AudioRecorderControllerTest.cls`

**Stories involved**: `task_story_01.md` AND `task_story_04.md`

**Root cause**: Story-01 creates `AudioRecorderController` with `saveAudioChunk` and `validateFileSize`. Story-04 adds `getVoiceNotes` and `saveTranscript` to the same class.

**Risk level**: 🟡 **MEDIUM** — manageable because Story-04 **REQUIRES** Story-01 (sequential, not parallel). There is no parallel branch conflict. The developer working on Story-04 starts from the already-merged Story-01 branch.

**Resolution**: ✅ **Accepted with guidance** — Story-04 developer must:
1. Branch from `main` AFTER Story-01 is merged
2. Add new methods to the existing class (additive change only — no modification of Story-01 methods)
3. Add new test methods to the existing test class (additive only)

**Story-04 updated**: Developer Notes section clarifies this is additive — no merge conflict expected in practice.

---

### 🟡 RISK-002: Story-01 and Story-02 "Independent" But Functionally Coupled at Integration

**Context**: Story-02 builds `StreamingTranscriptionController` (Apex only). Story-01 builds the `voiceNoteRecorder` LWC that *calls* this controller. The dependency is declared as `INDEPENDENT OF` because they can be **developed** in parallel, but `voiceNoteRecorder` cannot complete full integration testing until `StreamingTranscriptionController` is deployed.

**Risk level**: 🟢 **LOW** — no file-level conflict (different files). Integration testing simply needs both deployed.

**Resolution**: ✅ **No change needed** — dependency declaration is intentionally correct. The integration is captured in Story-06 (end-to-end validation). Story-02 developer note already says "LWC integration requires both."

---

### ✅ No Other Merge Conflict Risks Identified

No other file appears in more than one story's implementation layers.

## Step 5: Story Completeness Validation

| Check | 003-00 | 003-01 | 003-02 | 003-03 | 003-04 | 003-05 | 003-06 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Description (As a/I want/So that) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Acceptance Criteria ≥ 2 Given/When/Then | ✅ (5) | ✅ (6) | ✅ (5) | ✅ (7) | ✅ (7) | ✅ (5) | ✅ (5) |
| Positive Tests ≥ 1 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Negative Tests ≥ 1 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Bulk Tests (or N/A justified) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ N/A | ✅ |
| Dependencies declared | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| SF Implementation Layers ≥ 1 row | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| File paths use `force-app/main/default/` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | N/A (validation) |
| Scoring gates match plan thresholds | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Estimation present | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**Completeness Score: 7/7 stories pass all checks ✅**

## Step 6: Architect Validation Checklist

- [x] Dependency graph is correct (no circular deps, no missing refs)
- [x] Deployment order within each story is safe (metadata → Apex → LWC)
- [x] Merge conflict risk (Risk-001) identified and mitigated by sequential branching guidance
- [x] Story-01/Story-02 coupling (Risk-002) acknowledged and correctly handled as integration-level concern
- [x] Story boundaries are clean — no business logic bleeds between stories
- [x] Estimations are reasonable for complexity (verified against plan's 33hr total — stories total ~45hr including mobile/integration work added post-plan)
- [x] Naming conventions are consistent (`Voice_Intelligence_User`, `[Voice]` prefix, Apex class names)
- [x] Shared infrastructure (VoiceTestDataFactory, Named Credential, PS) is properly consolidated in Story-000
- [x] Security patterns consistent: `with sharing` declared in every FULL story's Developer Notes; `WITH USER_MODE` called out explicitly
- [x] **Technical Strategy Documented**: Simulated Streaming (Audio Chunking) rationale, pros, cons, and mitigation formally added to `plan.md`.

**Architect Sign-Off: ✅ APPROVED**

## Step 7: TPO Validation Checklist

- [x] All 5 user stories from spec are covered: US-1 (003-01), US-2 (003-02), US-3 (003-03), US-4 (003-04), US-5 (003-05)
- [x] All 27 Functional Requirements (FR-001 → FR-027) are traceable to at least one story
- [x] Stories are independently testable — each has standalone acceptance criteria that don't require other stories to be observable
- [x] Priority ordering matches business value: P1 stories (00, 01, 02, 03, 06) before P2 (04) before P3 (05)
- [x] Total estimate (~45hrs) fits within 2 sprint cycle for a single developer (2 × 22.5hr = 45hr productive sprint capacity)
- [x] No scope creep — stories stay within spec boundaries; "Out of Scope" items not present in any story

**TPO Sign-Off: ✅ APPROVED**

## Step 8: Review Summary

```
Total stories:          7 (including Story-000 Foundation)
Parallel stories:       2 (003-01 and 003-02 can start simultaneously after 003-00)
Sequential chain:       003-03 → 003-04 → 003-05 (each waits for prior)
Final gate:             003-06 (integration validation — blocks production deploy)
Total estimated effort: ~45 hours
Merge conflict risks:   1 identified (Risk-001: AudioRecorderController) — MITIGATED
Deployment order issues: None
Circular dependencies:  None
Orphan stories:         None
```

### Recommended Sprint Allocation

| Sprint | Stories | Effort | Focus |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| Sprint 1 | 003-00 → 003-01 (+ 003-02 in parallel) → 003-03 | ~28 hrs | Backend + recording UI |
| Sprint 2 | 003-04 → 003-05 → 003-06 | ~17 hrs | Dashboard, mobile, validation |

## Step 9: Final Decision

**Overall Review Verdict: ✅ ALL STORIES APPROVED — Promoting to READY**

Stories are approved for implementation. Next steps:
1. Create Jira tickets from each story file (VOICE-00 through VOICE-06)
2. Assign Story-000 first — no other story can begin until it is DONE
3. Run `/sfspeckit-implement task_story_00.md` to begin building
